//-------------------
// PART 1: Animals: Array Syntax
//-------------------

// EXAMPLE: write code below that will log an array of animals.
// Store the array in a variable.
var animals = ["Zebra", "Giraffe", "Elephant"];
console.log(animals);

// EXAMPLE: Write code below that will log "Zebra" from the animals array
// YOUR CODE HERE
console.log(animals[0]);

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in array of
// animals from above.
console.log(animals.length);

// YOU DO: Write code that will reassign the last item in the animals
// array to "Gorilla"
animals[2] = "Gorilla";
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will add a new animal (type of your choice) to position 3.
animals.push("Platypus");
console.log(animals);

// YOU DO: Write code that will log the String "Elephant" in the animals array
animals.unshift("Elephant");
console.log(animals);

//-------------------
// PART 2: Foods: Array Methods
//-------------------

// YOU DO: Declare a variable that will store an an array of at least 4 foods (strings)
var foods = ["Mayo", "Grapes","Fancy parmesan, for when I have guests","That fake parmesan powder, for when I'm alone"];

// YOU DO: Write code below that will log the number of elements in the array of
// foods from above.
console.log(foods.length);

// YOU DO: Write code below that uses a method to add "broccoli" to the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify "broccoli" has been added
foods.push("broccoli");
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code below that removes the last item of food from the foods array and
// log the changed array to verify that item has been removed
foods.pop();
console.log(foods);

// YOU DO: Write code to add 3 new foods to the array.
  // There are several ways to do this - choose whichever you'd like!
// Then, log the changed array to verify the new items have been added
foods.push('real apples', 'wax apples', 'crabapples');
console.log(foods);
// YOU DO: Remove the food that is in index position 0.
foods.shift();
console.log(foods);
//-------------------
// PART 3: Where are Arrays used?
//-------------------

/*
Sometimes we need to hold on to multiple pieces of data, but have it grouped together in a list.
This is why programming languages have arrays!

One example of a web/mobile application that uses arrays is Instagram. Each user has a set of posts
associated with their account. Each post, is one of potentially many, that are grouped together in a list,
or, array.

The post itself likely has more complex data, but here's one way we can think about it:
*/

var posts = ["image at beach", "holiday party", "adorable puppy", "video of cute baby"];

// YOU DO: Think of a web application you commonly use. Where do you see LISTS utilized, where arrays
// may be storing data? Come up with 3 examples - they could be from different web applications or
// all from the same one.

// 1: Twitter: Followers, Following, Tweets, etc.
// 2: NBA Schedule: Each team's opponents/games are likely stored in an array
// 3: Airbnb: When navigating the list mode rather than the map mode. I'd be very curious to see how that array is managed, because there are so many sub classifications (zip code, price, etc.)

// Part 4: Don't let yourself forget everything from Section 2 of Pre-work
//-------------------

/*
YOU DO:
Using the variables defined below, write a program that will tell a user if they
will be able to call an Uber.

The user can call an uber if they have 15% battery remaining, or more. In this case, it doesn't matter
if the user has a charger at all, or what type.
The can call an uber if they have a charger and it is a car charger.

*/
var percentBatteryLeft = 12;
var hasCharger = true;
var chargerType = "car";

// Write your conditional here
// This line of code checks to see if the user has 15% or more battery on their phone. If so, it alerts them to the fact that they can call an uber
if (percentBatteryLeft >= 15) {
  console.log("You can call a dang uber!");
//This line of code only gets run if the first line of code comes back with the boolean "false". In that situation (the user doesn't have 15% battery), this line of code checks that the user both HAS a charger, and that their charger is a CAR charger. If both of these conditions are met, the code tells the user they can call an uber
} else if (hasCharger === true && chargerType === "car") {
  console.log("You can call a dang uber!");
// This line of code only gets run if the first two lines of code come back with the boolean "false". In that situation (the user doesn't have 15% battery OR the right type of charger), the line of code lets the user know they can't call an uber
} else {
  console.log("No uber for you, dude!");
}


// YOU DO - ANNOTATE: Above each line of your code for this if statement, create a comment.
// That comment should describe, in your own words, and as technically precise as possible,
// what the line of code below, does.

// MAKE 100% SURE that you have RUN the code in node in your command line, to ensure it works
// as you think it does🌟
